# General info
The repository contains 3 algorithms of sorting: quick sort, merge sort and introspective sort(quick sort with heap sort witch is used for small array parts). Project was done for measuring computational complexity, main function shows this case of use. It also can be used just for sorting.
# How to use
1. Go to specific folder.
2. make directory build and go there.
3. run comand `cmake ..`
4. run `make`
